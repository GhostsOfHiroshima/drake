- [ ] Search for duplicates among the [existing issues](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues), both open and closed.
- [ ] I am reasonably sure this is a genuine bug in `drake` and most likely not a user error. (If you run into an error and do not know the cause, please submit a "Trouble" issue instead.)
- [ ] Be considerate of the maintainer's time and make it as easy as possible to troubleshoot any problems you identify. Read [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) and [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) to learn about minimal reproducible examples. Format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) to make it easier for others to read.
